# Daily visuals (not daily at all)
A collection of random Pygame demos i make every day (not every day)

The rules I'm following are:
1. Keep the file size small (just a few kb)
2. Run at stable 60 fps with 1600x900 resolution

Of course, it's not a strict set of rules. I'm mostly doing this for fun with no real goal in mind.
If you want, feel free to use anything i made, or even upload your own creations to this repo (why why why why why)
